# Ultra mode (agent swarm)

Ultra is a toggle that turns the top-level agent into a swarm
orchestrator: instead of doing hard or decomposable work itself, it fans
the work out across **many parallel sub-agents** with the `ultra` tool.
It works with **any model** — sub-agents inherit the active session's
provider, model, thinking level, and permissions — and is available in
the TUI, in ACP editors (Zed, …), and in headless/goal runs.

## Enabling it

| Surface | How |
| --- | --- |
| TUI | `/ultra` (or `/ultra on` / `/ultra off`) — instant, persisted, shown as a bold `ultra` tag in the status bar |
| ACP editors | the **Ultra** toggle in the session config toolbar |
| Config file | `"ultra": true` in `~/.spettro/config.json` |

The setting is persistent and applies to the **next** run/turn (the
system prompt is fixed per run to keep prompt caching intact).

**Permission requirement:** Ultra needs the `restricted` or `yolo`
permission level. A swarm executes many sub-agents concurrently, and
`ask-first` would flood you with per-action approval prompts, so:

- turning Ultra on under `ask-first` is refused — switch first with
  `/permission restricted` or `/permission yolo`;
- if you later drop back to `ask-first`, Ultra is *suspended* (the
  toggle stays saved but the tool is not injected) until you raise the
  level again.

## How it works

When Ultra is on, the top-level agent:

1. gains the `ultra` tool (regardless of its manifest role — Ultra
   bypasses the usual `PrimaryOnly`/handoff gating by design);
2. receives extra system-prompt guidance: explore lightly, then
   decompose the main work as finely as independence allows and hand it
   to the swarm — one item per file/package/test suite, each with a
   distinct, non-overlapping scope.

The tool call looks like:

```json
{
  "description": "Add doc comments to every exported symbol",
  "prompt_template": "Add doc comments to all exported symbols in {{item}}, then run go vet on the package.",
  "items": ["internal/agent/ultra.go", "internal/acp/bridge.go", "internal/tui/model.go"],
  "subagent_type": "code"
}
```

- `prompt_template` must contain the `{{item}}` placeholder; each item
  fills it into one self-contained sub-agent task (sub-agents cannot see
  the parent's context or each other).
- Between **2 and 32** items per call; every filled prompt must be
  distinct.
- `subagent_type` picks the worker from the [agent manifest](../AGENTS.md)
  (default `code`); orchestrator agents are rejected.

Execution details:

- **Launch ramp** — up to 5 sub-agents start immediately, then one more
  every 700 ms, to avoid hammering the provider.
- **Concurrency cap** — set the `SPETTRO_ULTRA_MAX_CONCURRENCY`
  environment variable to hard-cap simultaneous sub-agents (default:
  uncapped beyond the ramp).
- **Retries** — transient provider failures (rate limits, availability)
  are retried per sub-agent with exponential backoff (3 s, 6 s, 12 s).
- **Results** — returned to the main agent **in input order** as an
  `<ultra_result>` block with a `completed/failed` summary; each
  sub-agent's final message is its entire handoff. The main agent is
  instructed to review the results, re-dispatch failures, and verify the
  integrated outcome.
- Sub-agents never get the `ultra` tool themselves (no recursive
  swarms), and the normal delegation depth limits still apply.

## Workspace isolation (worktrees)

A swarm that *edits* files can crowd the shared checkout: many agents
writing into one working tree, one `git status` full of everyone's
changes. Setting `"isolation": "worktree"` on the `ultra` call (or on a
single `agent` delegation) gives every sub-agent its own workspace
instead:

1. For each member, Spettro creates a git **worktree** under
   `.spettro/worktrees/<agent>-<id>/` in the project root, on a fresh
   **branch named after the sub-agent** (`spettro/code-3-a1b2c3`),
   forked from the current `HEAD`.
2. Each sub-agent runs with its cwd inside its own worktree, so
   concurrent edits never collide and the main checkout stays clean
   (`.spettro/` is auto-added to `.git/info/exclude`).
3. When the swarm finishes, the branches are **merged back one at a
   time, in item order**, into the main checkout; leftover uncommitted
   work is committed first, with a Conventional Commits message written
   by the LLM from the diff (same machinery as auto-commit; a stock
   `spettro: subagent … work` message is the fallback if that fails).
   After a successful merge the branch and its worktree are **deleted**.

Outcomes per member (visible as `merge="…"` in the `<ultra_result>`
block and in the `agent` tool's JSON result):

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `merged` | branch merged into the main checkout, then deleted |
| `no_changes` | the agent changed nothing; worktree and branch deleted |
| `conflict` | the merge conflicted: it was aborted and the **branch and worktree are kept** for manual resolution |
| `preserved` | the agent failed but left work behind; branch and worktree are kept so nothing is lost |
| `error` | a git step failed; details in the result |

Kept branches are reported with their paths; resolve them by merging
manually, then `git worktree remove <path>` and `git branch -D
<branch>` (leftovers also show up in `/storage`). Worktree isolation
requires the project to be a git repository with at least one commit.
Leave `isolation` unset for read-only fan-outs (research, review,
search) — worktrees would only add overhead there.

## Observability: watching the swarm

Every swarm member gets a **distinct instance name** — `code#1`,
`code#2`, … in item order — and every tool trace it emits carries that
name, so its activity is attributable end to end:

- **TUI transcript** — the swarm renders as its own bordered block,
  separate from ordinary delegations, headed by the agent type and a
  `N running · N done · N failed` count with a progress meter. Failures
  count as finished work, drawn red, so a struggling swarm reads as one
  at a glance. Every member stays listed with its outcome (`▶` running,
  `✓` done, `✗` failed) and shows what it is doing *right now* — its
  latest tool call, falling back to the item it was assigned. A fan-out
  wider than ten members is capped in the transcript block, keeping
  running members in preference to finished ones, so a swarm can never
  push the conversation off screen; the full list is one `ctrl+b` away.
- **`ctrl+b` activity panel** — the same swarm section, uncapped, above
  the activity list (which groups tool calls per instance name). A
  banner reminds you of `ctrl+b` when a swarm starts with the panel
  hidden.
- **ACP editors** — each member's lifecycle arrives as an
  `agent code#3: <item>` tool call, and its individual tool calls are
  prefixed `[code#3] …`, so editors show which agent is doing what.
- **Results** — the `<ultra_result>` block names each sub-agent
  (`name="code#3"`), so the orchestrator can refer to and re-dispatch a
  specific member.

## When to use it

Ultra shines on wide, parallelizable work: sweeping refactors, adding
tests or docs across many files, mass migrations, or repo-wide audits.
For trivial single-step tasks the agent is told to just do them
directly, and for a single delegation the regular `agent` tool remains
the right choice.

Note that a swarm multiplies token usage — every sub-agent is a full
agent run on the active model.

For work whose *structure* matters — verify each finding as it lands,
score three competing designs against each other, sweep until two rounds
turn up nothing new — see [Workflows](workflows.md), which replaces the
single fan-out with a script the model writes.
