# Commands and Keybindings

## Slash commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/help` | Show in-app help text. |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | Quit Spettro. |
| `/mode`, `/next` | Cycle active manifest agent/mode. |
| `/connect` | Open provider/local-endpoint connect dialog. |
| `/login` | Sign in to a Spettro subscription (device flow). See [Subscription](subscription.md). |
| `/logout` | Sign out and remove the saved Spettro subscription key. See [Subscription](subscription.md). |
| `/models` | Open model selector dialog (connected providers). |
| `/models <provider:model> [api_key]` | Set model directly; optional API key saves for provider. |
| `/goal <objective>` | Start an autonomous goal-mode run. See [Goal Mode](goal.md). |
| `/goal stop` | Abandon the active goal and cancel any in-flight run. |
| `/goal status` | Show the current goal's iteration count, no-progress counter, and elapsed time. |
| `/goal resume` | Resume an unfinished goal from a loaded session. |
| `/loop <time> <prompt>` | Run a prompt (or slash command) on a recurring interval, e.g. `/loop 5m check CI status` or `/loop 30m /compact`. Intervals use duration syntax (`30s`, `5m`, `1h30m`, minimum `10s`); the first run fires immediately. A firing that lands while a run is still in progress is skipped, not queued. |
| `/loop stop` | Stop the recurring loop (an in-flight iteration keeps running; `Esc` interrupts it). |
| `/loop status` | Show the active loop's prompt, interval, iteration count, and next firing. |
| `/permission <ask-first\|restricted\|yolo>` | Set execution policy. |
| `/permissions [ask-first\|restricted\|yolo]` | Show or set policy alias. |
| `/permissions debug <on\|off>` | Toggle permission diagnostics in UI. |
| `/budget <n\|0>` | Set request token budget (`0` = unlimited). |
| `/thinking <off\|low\|medium\|high\|x-high\|max>` | Set the reasoning/thinking level for the active model. Maps to Anthropic's thinking token budget and to `reasoning_effort` on OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible backends. Hidden for models the catalog does not flag as reasoning-capable; if a model rejects the chosen level, Spettro silently retries at a lower one. |
| `/ultra [on\|off]` | Toggle [Ultra mode](ultra.md): the top-level agent fans hard tasks out across a swarm of parallel sub-agents (works with any model; sub-agents inherit the active model). Requires the `restricted` or `yolo` permission level — refused under `ask-first`. |
| `/workflows` | List saved [workflow](workflows.md) scripts from `.spettro/workflows` and `~/.spettro/workflows`, with their descriptions and phases. |
| `/workflows show <name>` | Print a saved workflow's header and source. |
| `/workflows run <name> [json]` | Run a saved workflow, optionally with a JSON `args` value. Dispatches a turn instructing the agent to invoke it, so the model reviews and acts on the result. |
| `/workflows where` | Show the directories scanned for saved workflows. |
| `/plan [prompt]` | Switch to `plan` mode or run a planning request directly. |
| `/approve` | Execute pending plan through `coding` agent. |
| `/tasks [list\|add\|done\|set\|show\|rm\|clear]` | Manage the session task graph. `list` prints tasks in dependency order with `deps:` and `[blocked]` markers; `set` accepts `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked` or `cancelled`; `rm <id>` deletes a task (stripping references to it from other tasks' dependencies); `clear` prunes all completed/cancelled tasks. |
| `/mcp <list\|read\|auth>` | Manage MCP resources and auth. |
| `/skill list` | List installed Agent Skills. |
| `/skill install <source>` | Install a skill from a local path, https git URL, or `owner/repo` shorthand. |
| `/skill info <name>` | Show metadata + body excerpt for an installed skill. |
| `/skill enable <name>` / `disable <name>` | Toggle whether a skill is exposed to agents. |
| `/skill uninstall <name>` | Remove a previously installed skill. |
| `/skill where` | Show the discovery roots being scanned. |
| `/skill reload` | Re-scan skill directories (after manual install/remove). |
| `/skills` | Alias of `/skill`. |
| `/stats` | Show session token usage and prompt-cache metrics. |
| `/hooks` | Show effective runtime hooks (project + global). |
| `/memory [show]` | Show persistent cross-session memory (user + project). See [Persistent Memory](memory.md). |
| `/memory edit [user\|project]` | Edit a memory file in `$EDITOR`. |
| `/memory clear [user\|project\|all]` | Erase saved memory. |
| `/memory mine [n]` | Scan recent saved sessions in the background and draft candidate memories into the review inbox. |
| `/memory review` | Approve or discard drafted memory candidates (nothing saves without approval). |
| `/compact [focus...]` | Compact the current conversation (two-stage: offload oversized tool results to re-readable references, then summarize). |
| `/compact auto <status\|on\|off>` | Show/configure auto-compact. |
| `/compact policy` | Show compact thresholds and failure counters. |
| `/clear` | Save and clear the current conversation. |
| `/diff [path...]` | Show diffs of files modified this session (all, or given paths). |
| `/resume` | Open saved conversation picker. |
| `/rewind` | Restore files and/or conversation to a pre-edit checkpoint. See [Checkpointing](checkpointing.md). |
| `/checkpoints` | Show checkpoint count and shadow-store disk usage (this project and all projects). |
| `/storage` | Report what Spettro stores on disk, per artifact class. See [Storage](storage.md). |
| `/storage clean` | Interactive multi-select cleanup with safe defaults preselected; also available headless as `spettro clean`. |
| `/init` | Analyze codebase and create/update `SPETTRO.md`. |
| `/jobs [list]` | List background shell jobs started by the agent. |
| `/jobs kill <id\|all>` | Terminate a background job (or all of them). |
| `job-output` | Tool-only (not a slash command): fetches accumulated output of a background shell job (`job-N`), or pages through a **spooled** truncated tool result (`spool:N`). See [Session Lifecycle](session.md#tool-output-spooling). |
| `tool-output` | Tool-only: re-reads the full output of an earlier tool call that was offloaded to the session spool (by truncation or by compaction), with `id`/`offset`/`limit` paging. See [Session Lifecycle](session.md#tool-output-spooling). |
| `pty-start` / `pty-write` / `pty-kill` | Tool-only: interactive terminal sessions (REPLs, debuggers, ssh, watch-mode servers) the agent can type into. See [Interactive PTY sessions](pty.md). |
| `/remote` | Start the local HTTP/SSE control plane on `127.0.0.1` (default port `7878`). |
| `/remote :PORT` | Start the control plane on a specific port; falls back to a free port if it is busy. |
| `/remote local` | Start the LAN HTTP/SSE control plane on `0.0.0.0` (default port `7878`). |
| `/remote local :PORT` | Start the LAN control plane on a specific port; falls back to a free port if it is busy. |
| `/remote stop` | Stop the running control plane. |
| `/remote status` | Print the current URL and bearer token. |
| `/telegram setup <token>` | Save a Telegram BotFather token (encrypted) and validate it via `getMe`. Alias: `/tg`. |
| `/telegram allow <@u\|id>` | Add a Telegram username or chat ID to the allowlist. |
| `/telegram start` / `/telegram stop` | Start or stop the relay's long-poll worker. Autostarted on next launch when previously running. |
| `/telegram status` / `/telegram list` | Print runtime state, bound chats and allowlist. |
| `/telegram deny <@u\|id>` / `/telegram reset` | Remove an allowlist entry or wipe the entire relay configuration. |
| `/<custom> [args]` | Run a user-defined command from `~/.spettro/commands/` or `<root>/.spettro/commands/`. See [Custom Slash Commands](custom-commands.md). |

## Agent usage

- Type `@` in the input to open repository file suggestions and insert mentions.
- Use the native `agent` tool to spawn sub-agents; multiple calls in one response run in parallel.
- `/approve` executes a previously generated pending plan.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle active mode/agent. |
| `F2` | Next favorite model. |
| `Shift+F2` | Previous favorite model. |
| `Ctrl+O` | Toggle transcript tool details (trimmed outputs). |
| `Ctrl+G` | Toggle full (untrimmed) tool outputs; implies details visible. |
| `Ctrl+C` twice | Quit with safety confirmation. |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit immediately. |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste image from clipboard (vision-capable models only). |
| `Ctrl+F` | Attach a workspace file path to your next prompt. |
| `Ctrl+R` | Remove the most recent attachment. |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Copy the last assistant response to clipboard. |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle text-select mode (mouse capture on/off). |
| `Up` / `Down` | Navigate command suggestions and dialogs. |
| `Tab` | Move selection in dialogs/palettes. |
| `Esc` | Interrupt the current agent run (stops and abandons goals and loops). |
| `Esc Esc` | Open the rewind checkpoint picker (when idle). See [Checkpointing](checkpointing.md). |

## Notes

- While a run streams, the status bar shows a live ticker: elapsed time and tokens streamed.
- Diffs highlight the changed words *within* modified lines, in both unified and side-by-side layouts.
- `/approve` requires a pending plan (typically produced in `plan` mode).
- In `ask-first`, coding prompts are gated by approval flow.
- Shell approval options: allow once, allow always, deny, or provide an alternative instruction.
- "Allow always" persists normalized command approvals in `.spettro/allowed_commands.json`.
- `/connect` includes `Local endpoints (LM Studio/Ollama/llama.cpp/…)` and probes `/v1/models`. Multiple local endpoints can be connected side by side; each can optionally carry an API key (for servers started with authentication, e.g. `llama-server --api-key`), and existing endpoints can be managed (edit key / remove) from the same dialog.
- In `/models`, press `f` to toggle favorites for highlighted model.
- Pressing `Enter` on a highlighted command suggestion inserts it first; pressing `Enter` again executes it.
- `/goal` runs the **coding** orchestrator autonomously. Interrupt with `Esc` or `/goal stop`. Permission `yolo` is required for fully unattended operation; otherwise approval prompts pause the loop. See [Goal Mode](goal.md).
- `/clear` **saves** the session first, then starts fresh. The saved session is available via `/resume`. See [Session Lifecycle](session.md).
- `/compact` compacts the transcript in two stages: oversized tool results are first replaced with `[offloaded: …]` stubs the agent can re-read via `tool-output` (lossless), then the remainder is summarized. Auto-compact triggers at 85 % context window by default and skips the summary entirely when offloading alone frees enough space. See [Session Lifecycle](session.md).
- `/login` and `/logout` manage your Spettro Subscription. See [Subscription](subscription.md).
- Clipboard pasting (`Ctrl+V`), file attachments (`Ctrl+F`), and text-select mode (`Ctrl+T`) are described in [Clipboard and Attachments](clipboard.md).
- The first-launch onboarding wizard is documented in [Onboarding](onboarding.md).
- Runtime hooks (`/hooks`) are documented in [Runtime Hooks](hooks.md).
- User-defined slash commands (reusable prompt files with `{{args}}` and shell interpolation) are documented in [Custom Slash Commands](custom-commands.md).
