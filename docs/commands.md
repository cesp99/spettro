## Agent usage

- Type `@` in the input to open repository file suggestions and insert mentions.
- Use `TOOL_CALL` with `{"tool":"agent",...}` to spawn sub-agents; multiple `TOOL_CALL` lines run in parallel.
- `/approve` executes a previously generated pending plan.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle active mode/agent. |
| `F2` | Next favorite model. |
| `Shift+F2` | Previous favorite model. |

| `Ctrl+C` twice | Quit with safety confirmation. |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit immediately. |
| `Up` / `Down` | Navigate command suggestions and dialogs. |
| `Tab` | Move selection in dialogs/palettes. |

## Notes

- `/approve` requires a pending plan (typically produced in `plan` mode).
- In `ask-first`, coding prompts are gated by approval flow.
- Shell approval options: allow once, allow always, deny, or provide an alternative instruction.
- "Allow always" persists normalized command approvals in `.spettro/allowed_commands.json`.
- `/connect` includes `Local endpoint (LM Studio/Ollama)` and probes `/v1/models`.
- In `/models`, press `f` to toggle favorites for highlighted model.
- Pressing `Enter` on a highlighted command suggestion inserts it first; pressing `Enter` again executes it.
