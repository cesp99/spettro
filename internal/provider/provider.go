// ThinkingLevel selects how much "extended thinking" / reasoning compute the
// model should spend before answering. Levels are normalized across providers:
//
//   - off       no extended thinking (default for chat-style use)
//   - low       short reasoning budget (e.g. ~2k thinking tokens)
//   - medium    medium reasoning budget (e.g. ~5k thinking tokens)
//   - high      long reasoning budget (e.g. ~16k thinking tokens)
//   - x-high    maximum reasoning budget (e.g. ~32k thinking tokens)
//
// Not every provider supports every level. Adapters map ThinkingLevel to their
// native parameter — for Anthropic Claude Opus/Sonnet that's `thinking.type`
// (enabled vs disabled) plus `thinking.budget_tokens`; for OpenAI and
// OpenAI-compatible backends (Groq, xAI, DeepSeek, Google's compat endpoint,
// local servers, …) it's `reasoning_effort`. Levels the underlying model does
// not support fall back to the closest supported one (e.g. Claude only has
// off and high).
