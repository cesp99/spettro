Each question takes a short header (the tab label the UI shows), the question line, and up to 8 options; give every option a label plus a one-line description of what choosing it means, mark the one you would pick with is_recommended (the UI highlights and pre-selects it), and set preview when there is concrete content — a snippet, a layout, a config — worth showing beside the option. Set multi_select when several answers can hold at once: there is no exclusivity flag, so phrase those options such that any subset of them reads sensibly — an option that rules the others out has to say so in its own words. Set allow_custom when written input is useful: the user gets a free-text entry and their words come back verbatim, quoted. Answers return one line per question, keyed by header; a question the user skipped is marked as unanswered, so never read silence as agreement with your recommendation, and a multi-select question answered with none of the options is marked as such — that is a decision about them, not silence.
